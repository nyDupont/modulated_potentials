    Return a tuple of two numpy arrays x and p to be plotted in a phase space (PS). Both are of shape
    (nx*np, nper*ndt).

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : function the integrator will numerically solve. Has to be previously defined returning Hamilton equations
             in my case,
    param : tuple of param passed to the system (e.g. the frequency omega if system is the harmonic oscillator),
    xmin, xmax, pmin, pmax : floats bounding the rectangular sampling of initial conditions (IC) of the PS,
    nx, np : ints of how many IC are to be computed along x- and p-axis,
    nper : int, number of periods of modulation to check,  |  This has been programmed to obtain the PS of a system
    ndt : step times by periods,                           |  modulated in time. Anyway, for each IC, simulation
                                                           |  is of duration (nper*2*pi) and (nper*ndt) discretized.
    integrator : function, numerical integrator to be used,
                (i.e. the angle of the PoincarÃ© section intersecting the phase space torus in the (x, p, t) space.)
    xmodulo, pmodulo : floats to be specified if one wants to fold the PS on itself, for instance when the system is
                       xmodulo-periodic in x and/or pmodulo-periodic in p (i.e. invariant by such discrete translations)
                       along those axis, Note: has not yet been implemented along the p-axis.
    sampling : string, o
    sampling_density : string, to switch from a constant sampling density to a arc-sigmoidal sampling density, getting
                       more CI arround the center of the PS. Options are ['const', 'asig'],
    sampling_amp : weight of that irregular non rectangular sampling. The smaller it is, the more regular the sampling
                   is.

    About x and p returned by the function : the first dimension is the number of initial conditions computed and the
    second dimension is the common length of each trajectory.

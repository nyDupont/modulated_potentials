    phase_space(system, param, vect_ic, nper, ndt=200, integrator=rk4, xmodulo=None, pmodulo=None)

    Return a tuple of two numpy arrays x and p to be plotted in a phase space (PS). Both are of shape
    (nx*np, nper*ndt).

    Parameters
    ----------
    system : function the integrator will numerically solve. Has to be previously defined returning Hamilton equations
             in my case,
    param : tuple of param passed to the system (e.g. the frequency omega if system is the harmonic oscillator),
    vect_ic : python iterable of tuples (x_i, p_i), the set of initial conditions under which the trajectories will be
              plotted,
    vect_t : python iterable, being the time vector along |  This has been programmed to obtain the PS of a system
             which the system is integrated,              |  modulated in time. Anyway, for each IC, simulation
                                                          |  is of duration (nper*2*pi) and (nper*ndt) discretized.
    integrator : function, numerical integrator to be used,
    xmodulo, pmodulo : floats to be specified if one wants to fold the PS on itself, for instance when the system is
                       xmodulo-periodic in x and/or pmodulo-periodic in p (i.e. invariant by such discrete translations)
                       along those axis, Note: yet to be implemented along the p-axis.

    About x and p returned by the function : the first dimension is the number of initial conditions computed and the
    second dimension is the common length of each trajectory.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, p: two numpy arrays. Their first dimension is the number of trajectories they contain (i.e. the number of initial
          condition computed) and the second dimension is the common length of each trajectory (i.e. the length of the
